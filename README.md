# BlueBerry-Wine-Analysis
Wine Quality Analytics
BlueBerry Winery, a start-up wine maker in Portugal, asked for help to determine the quality of wines based on their composition.
The goal of the project is to prepare the data to be fitted to a Machine Learning algorithm, analyse the data (taking into consideration the business questions), and present your findings.
